# TS-CLI-Template (WIP)

This is a project template for me to use in basic TypeScript backed CLI applications.

## Usage

Create a new project from this GitHub template

Clone your new repo to your local workstation.

Change the name in `package.json` to the name of your new CLI application

Add your actions to the array in `src/Actions/index.ts` with the object values of command, description, and action function handler.
